# ICS3U RST: Final Software Project

Thanks for accepting the RST Repository. This repository contains an Eclipse project for you to store ALL your files for the final project.

Follow the instructions on the [course website](https://mrsspindler.github.io/ICS3UC_Notes/3U_HTML_Files/Unit%202/Activity%201%20Creating%20Java%20Programs%20using%20Eclipse.html#CloneImport) to clone this repository to your computer and import the project into Eclipse.

You will need to repeat this process for EACH computer that you use for this course (eg: school and home!)

Don't forget to ALWAYS start your coding sessions with a PULL and end with a PUSH - make sure everything gets pushed to the cloud!

Happy coding!
